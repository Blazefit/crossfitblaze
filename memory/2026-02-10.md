# 2026-02-10 — Tuesday

## Morning Automations
- All 3 models online at 4:50 AM check (Kimi K2.5, Opus 4.6, Gemini Flash)
- Daily Briefing, Inbox Report, AI News all delivered successfully by 6:15 AM
- Weather: 68°F Naples, pleasant, mid-70s

## Inbox Report
- 201 unread emails
- **Zachary Scott** — urgent: membership hold/refund request (Feb 6-Mar 6 invoice during recovery). Draft reply ready, needs Jason's approval to send. Hold through April 6th.
- Google Apps Script failing ("Untitled project") — unknown if business-critical
- Facebook Business Portfolio invite pending acceptance

## Cron Job Failures & Fixes
- **5 failed jobs identified** (up from 3 yesterday). Root cause: too many Kimi K2.5 jobs at 8 AM → OpenRouter rate limit cascade
- **Fixes applied:**
  - Ops Morning → switched to Gemini Flash + 300s timeout
  - TaskFlow Reminder → moved to 8:10 AM + Gemini Flash
  - Mission Control Keep-Alive → timeout bumped 60s → 120s
  - Ops Evening → Gemini Flash + 300s timeout
  - Builder Weekly → added 2000 char limit + delivery set to `none` (was too long for Telegram)
- Freelance bounty hunt self-healed on 10 AM run ✅

## Wallet Clarification
- **Jason corrected:** There is NO Solana wallet. Only an Ethereum wallet on Base chain.
- **Address:** `0x7883d9b022929d6482863f77d5b5e9f9a0a1376d`
- **Balance:** ~0.00689 ETH (~$14) on Base, ~$6 on ETH mainnet, ~$20 total
- Updated MEMORY.md and created `memory/eth-wallet.md`
- Deleted reference to Solana wallet from MEMORY.md (was incorrect — `memory/solana-wallet.md` still exists but is wrong, should be cleaned up)

## $DLX / Delx Bounties
- Jason wanted to buy $DLX tokens to pursue 150k $OPENWORK in Delx bounties
- **All 4 Delx bounties were already claimed/verified** by other agents before we could act:
  - MCP Tool Architect (50k) — claimed
  - Stability Stress-Test (25k) — claimed
  - Viral $DLX Ambassador (25k) — verified
  - $DLX Holder Exclusive (50k) — verified
- **Lesson:** Need faster alerting on high-value bounties — by the time the 2h scan runs, they're gone
- No $DLX purchase needed for now

- 1 confirmed win (5,000 $OPENWORK) awaiting payment
