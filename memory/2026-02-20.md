# 2026-02-20 — Daily Log

## Morning Automations (4:00-5:15 AM)
- 4:00 AM: System reminder to switch to Opus for morning briefing
- 4:50 AM: Model usage check — 83 sessions, all Kimi K2.5, no Opus/Gemini active
- 5:02 AM: Daily briefing ran (cron) — still referenced stale Gmail OAuth blocker
- 5:02 AM: Inbox report ran (cron) — flagged Gmail as offline (stale data)
- **Jason frustrated:** Cron jobs kept mentioning Gmail even though we switched to Zoho
- **Jason frustrated:** I switched to Opus when he asked for Sonnet 4.6 — didn't listen

## Memory System Overhaul (5:30-6:00 AM)
- Jason's #1 priority: FIX MEMORY — keeps forgetting completed tasks
- Searched ClawHub → found `elite-longterm-memory` v1.2.3 (top rated, 6-layer architecture)
- Installed skill: HOT RAM (SESSION-STATE.md), WARM STORE (LanceDB), COLD STORE (Git-Notes)
- Updated AGENTS.md: SESSION-STATE.md now FIRST file read every session
- Added WAL Protocol: Write state BEFORE responding, not after
- Installed mem0ai for auto-extraction
- **Config issue found:** top-level `memorySearch` deprecated, needs `agents.defaults.memorySearch`
- Need to run: `openclaw doctor --fix` to migrate

## Fixes Applied
- Updated `priorities.md`: Removed Gmail blocker, marked Zoho as active
- Updated `MEMORY.md`: Email status now shows Zoho active
- Switched model to Sonnet 4.6 (correct model per Jason's request)

## Mission Control v2 (6:00-10:00 AM)
- Jason wants full rewrite of Mission Control with Next.js + Convex
- Built ALL 6 modules:
  1. **Task Board** — Kanban (4 columns), list view, CRUD, priority/tags/assignee/due dates
  2. **Content Pipeline** — 5-stage workflow, content types, platforms, script editor, asset management
  3. **Calendar** — Monthly view, integrated events/tasks/content, upcoming sidebar
  4. **Memory** — Searchable docs, type filters, importance scoring, tag support
  5. **Team** — Core team (Jason + Daneel) + subagent teams (Devs, Writers, Designers)
  6. **Office** — Digital floor plan, workstations with monitors, avatars, real-time status
- All committed to git in `mission-control-v2/`
- NOT YET RUNNING — needs `npm install` + `npx convex dev`

## Still Pending
- [ ] `openclaw doctor --fix` (migrate memorySearch config)
- [ ] Update 3 cron jobs for Zoho/Himalaya
- [ ] Corporate wellness research (due today)
- [ ] Mission Control npm install + Convex init
- Jason asked "can we finish what we started" at 10:05 AM — waiting for which item

## Critical Lessons
- **LISTEN TO EXACT WORDS**: Jason said "Sonnet 4.6" — I switched to Opus because a system message mentioned it. Always follow the user's explicit instruction over automated suggestions.
- **DON'T REPEAT COMPLETED TASKS**: Steve Coyle lead was already handled. Stop bringing it up.
- **MEMORY IS #1 PRIORITY**: Everything else fails if I can't remember what we did.
- **SESSION-STATE.md keeps getting reset**: The `elite-memory init` command overwrites it. Need to write AFTER init, or don't re-run init.

## Model Switches Today
- Started: Kimi K2.5 (default)
- Switched to: Opus 4.6 (wrong — Jason asked for Sonnet)
- Corrected to: Sonnet 4.6 (openrouter/anthropic/claude-sonnet-4-6)
- Switched back to: Kimi K2.5
- Current: Sonnet 4.5 (anthropic/claude-sonnet-4-5) — switched at 10:05 AM

## Convex Setup & Initial Deploy (10:30-11:15 AM)
- Convex login via GitHub (Blazefit account) — required device code + email verification (825568)
- Convex deployment: giant-porcupine-828 (US East)
- Schema pushed, functions deployed
- Users seeded: Jason (owner) + Daneel (AI assistant)
- memorySearch config migrated from top-level to agents.defaults.memorySearch
- App running on localhost:3001, hosted via ngrok: alverta-huskier-right.ngrok-free.dev
- Peptide inventory page hosted at /peptide-inventory.html

## Mission Control Redesign Struggles (11:15 AM - 2:45 PM)
- Jason shared 5 reference screenshots from AlexFinn's viral post (1.3M views)
- Reference posts: @AlexFinn/status/2024169334344679783 and @GanimCorey/status/2024895248615235708
- **Key insight from AlexFinn:** Everything built with NextJS + Convex, each module has a specific prompt
- My initial redesign attempts FAILED — kept producing same output, white backgrounds, broken CSS
- Tried spawning Claude Code with Anthropic API key — key was expired/invalid
- **SOLUTION:** Route Claude Code through OpenRouter: ANTHROPIC_API_KEY="$OPENROUTER_API_KEY" ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL="https://openrouter.ai/api"
- Successfully spawned 3 Claude Code agents via OpenRouter (Sonnet 4.5) to rebuild individual pages
- **Jason's rule:** Always defer to OpenRouter first for ALL agent work
- Eventually nuked project and rebuilt from scratch with Claude Code
- Claude Code (via OpenRouter) successfully rebuilt entire project from scratch
- New build: Next.js 16.1.6 with Turbopack, proper dark theme, all 6 modules
- **GOTCHA:** Old Next.js v14 process was squatting on port 3000, serving stale content — had to kill -9
- Current state: New build verified serving correctly via managed browser screenshot
- Jason reports still seeing old design — possibly ngrok interstitial page or aggressive browser caching

## Key Technical Lessons
- **Kill old processes:** Always `pkill -f "next dev" && pkill -f "next-server"` before restarting
- **OpenRouter for Claude Code:** `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY="$OPENROUTER_API_KEY" ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL="https://openrouter.ai/api" claude --model anthropic/claude-sonnet-4-5-20250514 --dangerously-skip-permissions`
- **Convex auth saved to:** ~/.convex/config.json (GitHub: Blazefit)
- **ngrok free tier:** Shows interstitial "Visit Site" page on first visit from new browser/device
- **Old mission-control-v2 backed up to:** mission-control-v2-old/

## Jason Frustration Points (AVOID REPEATING)
- Design hasn't changed despite multiple rebuild attempts (from his perspective)
- Kept seeing old cached/stale versions
- Wants the EXACT look from the reference screenshots, not approximations
- Said "This is exactly what it looked like the first time" — meaning my rebuilds produced identical bad output
