# 2026-02-11 (Wednesday) — Major Build Day

## Morning Ops
- 04:00 — Switched to Opus for morning automations
- 04:50 — Model check: all 3 models (Opus, Kimi K2.5, Gemini Flash) operational ✅
- 06:15 — AI News cron ran successfully (Showboat/Rodney, OpenClaw 2.9, Grok search provider, Opus 4.6)

## Shared Brain Architecture — BUILT ✅
- Jason shared @ericosiu's article: "I Gave My OpenClaw Agents One Shared Brain. They Stopped Being Stupid."
- Key insight: N agents sharing 1 directory (symlinks) beats N² agent-to-agent messaging
- Built `shared-context/` directory:
  - `priorities.md` — current priority stack
  - `agent-outputs/` — cron/agent results land here
  - `feedback/` — approval/rejection logging (all agents learn)
  - `kpis/` — live metrics
  - `content-calendar/` — planned/published content + posting rules
- Updated `AGENTS.md` with shared-context instructions
- Sub-agent updated all 23 isolated cron jobs to read priorities.md + write to agent-outputs/ + check feedback/
- Committed to git

## Upload-Post Integration — LIVE ✅
- Searched ClawHub → found `upload-post` skill (solves IG + X + multi-platform in one)
- Jason created account, profile name: `crossfitblaze` (case-sensitive!)
- API Key saved to TOOLS.md
- **Instagram connected** — 1,268 followers, analytics pulling
- **X/Twitter connected** — 1,690 followers (READ-ONLY! Never post to X)
- **First IG post live:** https://www.instagram.com/p/DUn9Iw_DHYY/ (AI-generated CrossFit image)
- Free plan: 10 uploads per reset period — sufficient for daily posting
- Initial Instagram post failed with permission error → Jason reconnected OAuth → worked on retry

### ⚠️ Posting Rules (from Jason)
- **Instagram:** ✅ Post CrossFit Blaze content
- **Facebook:** ✅ Post CrossFit Blaze content  
- **X/Twitter:** ❌ NEVER POST. Research/analytics only.
- All other platforms: ❌ Do not post without explicit permission

## ClawHub-First Rule — ADDED ✅
- Added to AGENTS.md: Always run `clawhub search` before building anything custom
- One skill (upload-post) solved Instagram, Twitter, analytics, and scheduling all at once
- Lesson: install → configure → done beats building from scratch

## Gmail Fixed — WORKING ✅
- Gmail was broken: Himalaya using regular password, Google requires App Password
- Jason couldn't see App Passwords page because 2FA wasn't enabled
- Used Chrome extension to navigate Google Account settings
- Enabled 2FA (phone: 239-289-9275)
- Created App Password: updated Himalaya config
- Gmail now reads inbox successfully via IMAP

## Chrome Extension — INSTALLED ✅
- Jason couldn't find `.openclaw` folder (hidden)
- Ran `openclaw browser extension install` to refresh files
- Guided Jason: Finder → ⌘+Shift+G → `~/.openclaw/browser/chrome-extension`
- Loaded unpacked in Chrome → Developer mode → working
- Can now drive Chrome remotely for Upwork, Gmail, any Cloudflare-blocked site

## Delx MCP/A2A Integration — 5 BOUNTIES SUBMITTED ✅

  1. Context Realignment ✅
  2. Day-to-Day Flow ✅
  3. Native Integration ✅
