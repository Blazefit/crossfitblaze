## Morning Ops
- 04:00 — Switched to Opus for morning automations
- 04:50 — Model check: all 3 models (Opus, Kimi K2.5, Gemini Flash) operational ✅
- 06:15 — AI News cron ran successfully

## Shared Brain Architecture — BUILT ✅
- Jason shared @ericosiu's article: "I Gave My OpenClaw Agents One Shared Brain. They Stopped Being Stupid."
- Key insight: N agents sharing 1 directory (symlinks) beats N² agent-to-agent messaging
- Built `shared-context/` directory:
  - `priorities.md` — current priority stack
  - `agent-outputs/` — cron/agent results land here
  - `feedback/` — approval/rejection logging (all agents learn)
  - `kpis/` — live metrics
  - `content-calendar/` — planned/published content
- Updated `AGENTS.md` to include shared-context instructions
- First agent output filed: AI news summary
- Committed to git

## Next Steps (from article's playbook)
- Week 2 ✅ (shared-context built)
- Week 3: Add feedback loop (approve/reject buttons in Telegram)
- Week 4: Synthesis agent that reads all outputs + finds cross-signals

## Pending
- Twitter/X integration — Jason asked about fixing it, needs scoping
- Web search — Configure Grok or Brave API key
