## Notes

**Email Access Issue:**
The Google Workspace Blaze MCP (which provides Gmail access) is configured and working in main sessions, but MCP tools are not available to cron-isolated sessions for security. Options:
1. Configure IMAP credentials for overnight email checking
2. Use main session for email processing
3. Set up dedicated email-checking service

**No Urgent Items:**
No customer emails, leads, or urgent tasks requiring Jason's immediate attention.

**Morning Handoff:**
- Routine tasks pending (Laura Ward charge, Tom Wooden account check)
- No overnight emergencies
- Systems nominal
