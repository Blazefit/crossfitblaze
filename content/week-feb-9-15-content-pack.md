**Format:** Photo split or Reel

**Caption:**

30 days ago Tom couldn't do a burpee without dying.

Today? He finished the WOD 3 minutes faster and didn't even need the extra chalk break.

The secret?
→ Showed up 4x/week
→ Asked coaches for scaling options
→ Tracked his progress
→ Celebrated small wins

You don't need to be fit to start.
You need to start to get fit.

Who's ready to commit to 30 days?
