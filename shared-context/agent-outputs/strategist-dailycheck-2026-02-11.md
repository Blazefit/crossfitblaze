## ⚠️ Blockers Requiring Action

1. **Lead Follow-up OVERDUE** — Lourdes (Spanish-speaking parents, 65yo) — 5 days cold
   - *Recommendation:* Personal call today, emphasize Spanish-speaking coaches
   
2. **High-Value Bounties Blocked** — 4 Delx jobs (400k $OPENWORK) require MCP infrastructure
   - *Recommendation:* Prioritize Delx MCP setup (ROI: 400k $OPENWORK unlocked)

3. **Content Pipeline** — Tom's spotlight ready but needs Jason's photo/quote
   - *Quick ask:* 2-min text to Tom for quote + action photo

---

## 🎯 Recommended Priorities for Remainder of Week

1. **Today:** Save Lourdes lead (phone call)
2. **Thursday:** Film Valentine's Partner WOD (content opportunity)

## 📝 Notes for Daneel/Jason

- Feedback system ready (feedback-2026-W07.json) but empty — need Jason's reactions to learn preferences
- No revenue/attendance data flowing to shared context yet — consider Kilo API integration
- Spark content is flowing well; only dependency is Jason's input for member features
