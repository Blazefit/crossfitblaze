## 📅 Today's Content: Wednesday, Feb 11

### Member Spotlight: Tom — 30 Days In

**Status:** ✅ Caption ready | ⚠️ Needs: Photo + quote from Tom

**Hook:** 30 days ago, Tom couldn't do a push-up. Today?

**Caption (ready to post):**
```
30 days ago, Tom walked in saying "I'm not sure I can do this."

Today? He's 10lbs down, sleeping better, and just finished his first full RX workout.

The best part? He's not the same guy who walked through that door.

Tom, welcome to the family. This is just the beginning. 🚀

Tag someone who needs to start their journey.

- Evening: Tom's quote/feedback feature

**Need from Jason:**
- [ ] Photo of Tom (action shot preferred)
- [ ] Quote or feedback from Tom about his first 30 days
