## 2. Day 1 Post-Class Check-in

**Subject:** How'd it go yesterday, {{name}}?

**Body:**
```
Hey {{name}},

Just wanted to check in — how did your first class feel?

I know CrossFit can seem intense at first, but remember: everyone started 
somewhere. The fact that you showed up is the hardest part done. 💪

A few questions:
• Any soreness? (Totally normal!)
• Did the workout feel manageable?
• Any questions about movements or the gym?

Your trial includes {{remaining_classes}} more classes — I'd love to see 
you again this week. Consistency is where the magic happens.

Next beginner classes:
{{class_schedule}}

Let me know when you're coming in!

Jason

Hi {{name}},

Haven't seen you since your first class — everything okay?

are the ones who prioritize showing up (even when it's hard).

You've got {{remaining_classes}} classes left on your trial. Let's get 
you back in here!

This week's beginner times:

What day works for you? Just reply and I'll save you a spot.

## 5. Post-Trial "What Happened?"

**Subject:** Quick question, {{name}}

**Body:**
```
Hi {{name}},

Your trial ended and I didn't hear back — wanted to check in.

No pressure at all, just curious: what happened?

• Timing not right?
• Price concerns?
• Not what you expected?
• Something else?

I'm always trying to improve, so honest feedback helps.

And hey — if Blaze wasn't the right fit, no hard feelings. I can even 
recommend other gyms that might work better for you.

Either way, thanks for giving us a shot!

Jason
