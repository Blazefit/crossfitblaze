# Instagram Integration Setup Plan

**Date:** 2026-02-09
**Account:** @crossfitblaze
**Status:** Credentials received, API setup required

---

## OPTION 1: Instagram Basic Display API (Recommended)

**What it does:**
- Read account info and media
- Cannot post directly (Instagram restriction)
- Can get performance data

**Setup Steps:**
1. Go to https://developers.facebook.com/apps/
2. Create new app → Select "Other" → "Consumer"
3. Add "Instagram Basic Display" product
4. Add test user: crossfitblaze
5. Generate access token
6. Use token for API calls

**Capabilities:**
- ✅ Get follower count, reach, engagement
- ✅ Read your own posts
- ✅ Get Insights data
- ❌ Cannot auto-post (Instagram policy)

---

## OPTION 2: Instagram Graph API (Business Accounts)

**What it does:**
- Full business account features
- Can schedule posts (not immediate publish)
- Better analytics

**Setup Steps:**
1. Convert @crossfitblaze to Business Account (if not already)
2. Connect to Facebook Business Manager
3. Create app at developers.facebook.com
4. Request Instagram Graph API permissions
5. Get permanent access token

**Capabilities:**
- ✅ Schedule posts
- ✅ Reply to comments/DMs
- ✅ Detailed analytics
- ✅ Create stories
- ⚠️ Requires business verification

---

## OPTION 3: Manual Workflow (Immediate)

**What I can do right now:**
1. Prepare all content with captions/hashtags
2. Create posting schedule
3. Send you daily "content packs" via Telegram
4. Track performance manually (you screenshot Insights)

**Process:**
- Morning: I send you today's content (photo + caption)
- You post manually (2 minutes)
- Weekly: Send me Insights screenshots
- I update performance tracking

---

## RECOMMENDATION

**Start with Option 3 (Manual)** while setting up Option 1 or 2:

**This Week:**
1. I send you daily content packs (already ready)
2. You post manually
3. I set up Basic Display API for analytics

**Next Week:**
4. Get API access working
5. Automate performance tracking
6. Possibly schedule posts (if Graph API approved)

## IMMEDIATE ACTION

**Today's Content Pack (Monday, Feb 9):**

**Photo needed:** Sarah's first pull-up or recent member PR

**Caption:**
```
She walked in saying "I could never do a pull-up."

Four months later: ✅ FIRST PULL-UP CRUSHED

Sarah put in the work. Showed up when it was hard. 
Trusted the process.

What's your "I could never" that we can turn into "I just did"?

Drop a 💪 if you're showing up today.
