# SESSION-STATE.md — Active Working Memory

This file is the agent's "RAM" — survives compaction, restarts, distractions.
Chat history is a BUFFER. This file is STORAGE.

## Current Task
Mission Control v2 REBUILT FROM SCRATCH — live at https://alverta-huskier-right.ngrok-free.dev

## Key Context
- **Model:** Switched to Sonnet 4.5
- **Email System:** ✅ Zoho Mail active (daneel@aimissioncontrol.us) — Gmail deprecated
- **Memory System:** ✅ elite-longterm-memory installed, SESSION-STATE.md + WAL protocol in AGENTS.md
- **Mission Control v2:** ✅ All 6 modules built (Task Board, Content Pipeline, Calendar, Memory, Team, Office)
- **Config Issue:** memorySearch needs migration — run `openclaw doctor --fix`
- **Cron Jobs:** 3 jobs still need Zoho config update (were Gmail-dependent)
- **Corporate Wellness:** Research was due today (Friday Feb 20)
- **Kathryn Burton:** Drop-in window Feb 19-21 (day 2/3)
- **Steve Coyle:** Previously contacted — DO NOT re-raise, Jason already handled

## Pending Actions
- [x] Migrated memorySearch config to agents.defaults.memorySearch
- [ ] Update 3 cron jobs to use Zoho/Himalaya
- [ ] Corporate wellness research (10 companies + outreach template)
- [x] npm install + Convex init for Mission Control v2 (LIVE on port 3001)

## Completed Today
- [x] Installed elite-longterm-memory skill
- [x] Updated AGENTS.md with WAL protocol
- [x] Fixed stale Gmail references in priorities.md and MEMORY.md
- [x] Built all 6 Mission Control v2 modules
- [x] Switched model to Sonnet 4.6 (now 4.5)

## User Preferences (CRITICAL)
- Hates repeated questions about already-completed tasks
- Expects competence and adjustment on the fly
- Short commands, no filler responses
- Email drafts go to Jason first, never direct to clients
- X/Twitter: Read-only, NEVER post
